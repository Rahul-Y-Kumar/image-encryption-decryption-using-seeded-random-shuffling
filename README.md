# 🔐 Image Encryption And Decryption Tool

## 🔗 Description 
A simple Python-based GUI application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a **seed-based pixel shuffling algorithm**. Built with `Tkinter` for the interface and `Pillow` for image processing.

## 📌 Features
- 📂 Upload any `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` image
- 🔒 Encrypt image pixels using a seed key 
- 🔓 Decrypt the image with the same seed key
- 💾 Save encrypted/decrypted output to your desired location
- 🧠 Simple logic using deterministic pseudo-random shuffling
